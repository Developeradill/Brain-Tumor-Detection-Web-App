# Brain Tumor Detection Web Application

## Introduction
This project is a deep learning–based web application that detects brain tumors from MRI images using a convolutional neural network (CNN).

## Features
- MRI image upload
- Tumor / Normal classification
- Flask-based backend
- Clean web interface
- Voice feedback for results

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Flask

## Model Information
- CNN-based model
- Input size: 224 × 224
- Dataset: Public MRI dataset (Kaggle)

> Dataset source: Kaggle  
> Model adaptation, deployment, and web integration done by me.
